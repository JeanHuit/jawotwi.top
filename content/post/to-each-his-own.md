Life, in its living is froth with pain, joy, sadness, tears, smiles and many other words that describe the human condition.  
To each, a measure of sadness, joy, pain is handed and to each the capability to overcome what was handed is granted.  
I do not know if I am making sense to anyone out there.

> The human condition is defined as "the characteristics, key events, and situations which compose the essentials of human existence, such as birth, growth, emotionality, aspiration, conflict, and mortality.”

This post begun with an image I captured of a flower thriving among weeds. How it begun life there, I cannot tell. However, it lives.

Like this flower, we may find ourselves either by design or happenstance in situations that may or may not favour us, in situations that remind us of our human condition. We have the **choice** to be or not to be -happy | sad | alive | dead | hungry,thirsty | satisfied.

One of the most difficult things to be granted is a **choice**.

With choices, you get to live with the consequence of your action or inaction - “choice”, instead of laying the blame at someone else’s feet. This mental burden may just be the end of you.

Now, having a focus for the the choice you make, makes making that choice easier.

**I want to live** - makes making choices in that regard easier. Focussing on the smaller aspects of living might be overwhelming, but if your eye remains on the prize "living", you are surely going to not die. This might give excuse to doing anything and everything to live, but bear in mind, there are consequences for all those little actions and inactions you take.

The flower that begun this post in itself is unwanted, thus a weed.

Vita canis praecisae!
