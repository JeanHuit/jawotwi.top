<section class="post-content">
            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Yes, you. The period of silence on this blog has been loud.</p>
<p>Anyways, I am back with some sort of motivation  to continue to update this blog.</p>
<p>This post is a quick one.</p>
<p>How do you know which node you are using? To the developer, that'd be a simple question.  just do <code>node -v</code> right?</p>
<p>Well yes!<br>
But then have you ever encountered a particular project with its own set of node version different from yours? Most especially when the difference in version raises a whole lot of issues and yet, you still want to keep your version....</p>
<p>In walks the Node Version Manager or <strong>"NVM"</strong>.<br>
With the Manager, you get to have multiple versions of node on your local development machine. Now, I'd just like to speak on the <strong>n</strong> manager. Obviously, like node it self there are many managers our there. I have no special reason for installing <strong>n</strong>, just like that its not as mouthful as <strong>NVM</strong>.</p>
<p>We will be using <a href="http://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> to install "n"</p>
<pre><code>-&gt; brew install n
-&gt; n &lt;latest | stable | 6.9&gt;
-&gt; n #can be used to select version you will want to use

</code></pre>
<p>et voila!</p>
