The year is 2019 and if you have a thought process in any way similar to mine, you'd most likely prefer to start the year on a clean slate. Formatting and reinstalling only the essentials.
With time, one's workspace gets cluttered with 'one-time-use' softwares, 'no-longer-needed apps' and apps you might have forgotten about.

This is a listing of Apps that can and do succesfully replace sold/proprietary apps. 
>This will be updated when new  ones are discovered. You could also submit PR's to this [repo](https://github.com/JeanHuit/johnawotwi.me) with suggestions.
