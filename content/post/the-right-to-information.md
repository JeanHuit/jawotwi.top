            <p>Recently, I had the opportunity to attend a validation meeting on the right to access information in Ghana. Organised by the Coalition On the Right To Information, Ghana. This meeting was held to present findings of a Pilot project on the Gender dimension of access to information in Ghana.<br>
Some people were selected to visit certain public institutions  to request for information that was bound to be in the public domain.</p>
<hr>
The Findings:
<p>On a positive note, information refusal was not gender biased. Almost all requesters - those selected to go round, were denied the information they sort, being male or female did not make a difference, and that's the good news.<br>
However, requests for information was met with suspicion, outright denial  and the not so subtle back and forth tactics that is used in unwanted bureaucratic negotiation; bottlenecks at every turn.</p>
<p>Individuals cannot request for information. One must belong to a recognised institution to be able/have a need so great  to request for information.</p>
<p>Financial records/information was a no-go area.</p>
<hr>
There is this bill before the  parliament of Ghana, a  bill that in essence states that person(s) - citizens of the land have the right to request for information from public institutions and this request must be granted, no justification needed.
<p>Are we aware of said Bill ? Are we willing to push it into law? Are we as a country ready? Are we as citizens interested?</p>
<p>Right to information is a HUMAN RIGHT!</p>
