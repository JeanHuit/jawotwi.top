            <p>Did you know the world has 15% of its inhabitants being disabled and that 2-4% of the 15% have significantly high levels in functioning?</p><p>15% here amounts to <strong>1,080,000,000</strong> people!</p><blockquote><strong>The power of the web is in its universality. Access by everyone, regardless of  disability is an essential aspect. - Tim Berners -Lee</strong></blockquote><p>The Web is thus fundamentally designed for use, by the masses whatever their software, hardware, language or location.  Nothing should hinder persons with disabilities from using the Web. </p><p>Unfortunately, the webs universality ends with the remaining 75% of the world's inhabitants. </p><p>I styled my title to remove the notion that building/developing for the world wide web with people living with disabilities in mind, sidelines normal functioning individuals.  Building with disabilities in mind, is a merit to those living without.</p><p>Increase in speed {load times of websites} | Clear and Concise text with a focus on context are some of the advantages when developers build with disabilities in mind. These are positives for everyone concerned. </p><p><strong>How do we do this?</strong></p><h2 id="designing-for-the-web">Designing for the Web</h2><ul><li>Provide sufficient contrast between foreground and background</li><li>Do not use colour alone to convey information</li><li>Ensure forms have clear and concise corresponding labels</li><li>Provide identifiable feedback</li></ul><h2 id="writing-for-the-web">Writing for the Web</h2><ul><li>Provide informative unique page titles</li><li>Make link text meaningful</li><li>Write meaningful text alternatives for images</li><li>Create transcripts and captions for multimedia. <strong> </strong><em>Eg</em><strong>. </strong><em>Audio only content - podcast (transcripts)Video , Training Videos - (caption)</em></li></ul><h2 id="developing-for-the-web">Developing for the Web</h2><ul><li>Use Markup to  convey meaning and structure</li><li>Associate a label with every form control</li><li>Include alternative text for images</li><li>Write code that adapts to users technology. {be responsive}</li><li>Avoid CAPTCHA’s where possible <em>Eg.Not requiring captures for authenticated users, Provide more than two ways to solve CAPTCHA’s</em></li></ul><p>This list is definitely not exhaustive, there are  a lot more things  that can be done to make the web more accessible to the world. </p><hr><ul>
