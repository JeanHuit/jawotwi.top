            <p>An upcoming travel opportunity had me searching for a VPN service I could use whiles away from 127.0.0.1 . This search lead me to <a href="https://www.getoutline.org/en/home">Outline.</a> Â A free vpn tool tailored for journalist - Touted as granting you access to the "internet you can trust" , as having "strong privacy and security". </p><p>What led me to choose Outline over the rest, was the fact that you could run this vpn tool on your own server or a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server"> VPS</a> of your choice.</p><p>The three things you would need to get started:</p><ol>
<li>A VPS of your choice eg. Vultr, AWS, Google Platform, Digital Ocean etc</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-server/releases">The Outline Manger</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-client/releases">The Outline Client</a></li>
</ol>
<li>Spin up a linux based server on your VPS</li><li>Login to your server, <strong>ssh</strong> credentials should be available to you.</li><li>Follow the prompts on the Outline Manager to setup the server.</li><li>Download the Outline Client and add a server by copying and pasting an access key made available via the Outline Manager </li><p>And just like that you have a VPN connection setup. Your conversations, transactions etc etc are all free from prying eyes.</p><p>Another thing I like is that, I can just destroy my server and spin up another one and a completely new VPN connection anytime I want.</p>
