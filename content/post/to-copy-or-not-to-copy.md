            <p>So I got in late to the Humans of Ghana party. I must say that I have been an active follower of the Humans of New York page for a really long time, so my first reaction was, ebei! we have copied this too?</p>
<p>But then, anything worth anything is worth emulating, and I applaud the <strong>vim</strong>.</p>
<p>So I begun, just like I did with HoNY, from the latest post down to a post submitted on the 14th of January. I do not believe it's the maiden post of HoGH, but after 30 minutes scrolling, liking-a-many and sharing one, I think I get the picture.</p>
<p>Like anywhere in this world, there are good stories, inspiring ones, bad stories, funny ones etc etc. <a href="http://jeanhuit.github.io/to-each-his-own/">The human experience is vast and unique.</a>  Ghana is no exception.</p>
<p>And as always there are those that just can’t refrain from posting  unproductive comments, but hey, its their opinion and its amazing they’d rather say sh*t than say nothing.</p>
<p>I will like to say, I am awed by the effort the creators of the page  put in, the support of the amazing people of my motherland, especially those who through their contributions change/changed lives, the insightful statements from folks you least expect to hear such words.</p>
<p>So awed I was, I resurrected my sleeping blog (my slice of net heaven) to express my thoughts.</p>
<p>Today, HoGH has got a new fan/follower.</p>
<p>Shameless Promo:<br>
Find them on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/humansofghanaofficial/?fref=photo">Facebook</a> and on <a href="http://www.instagram.com/humansofgh">Instagram</a></p>
<p>Keep up the good work folks; <strong>Ghana, one click, one story at a time.</strong> ampa!</p>
