So I got in late to the Humans of Ghana party. I must say that I have been an active follower of the Humans of New York page for a really long time, so my first reaction was, ebei! we have copied this too?

But then, anything worth anything is worth emulating, and I applaud the **vim**.

So I begun, just like I did with HoNY, from the latest post down to a post submitted on the 14th of January. I do not believe it's the maiden post of HoGH, but after 30 minutes scrolling, liking-a-many and sharing one, I think I get the picture.

Like anywhere in this world, there are good stories, inspiring ones, bad stories, funny ones etc etc. [The human experience is vast and unique.](http://jeanhuit.github.io/to-each-his-own/) Ghana is no exception.

And as always there are those that just can’t refrain from posting unproductive comments, but hey, its their opinion and its amazing they’d rather say sh\*t than say nothing.

I will like to say, I am awed by the effort the creators of the page put in, the support of the amazing people of my motherland, especially those who through their contributions change/changed lives, the insightful statements from folks you least expect to hear such words.

So awed I was, I resurrected my sleeping blog (my slice of net heaven) to express my thoughts.

Today, HoGH has got a new fan/follower.
