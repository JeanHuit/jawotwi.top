There is a password storm brewing and it all started with Google announcing a chrome extension that will inform users if their passwords have been used or shared online or are insecure, whenever they log into online services.

With this in mind, I put together a password generator to get you up when you are down.

Find it at [https://passg.herokuapp.com/](https://passg.herokuapp.com/.)

### Here is how:
```
- Visit the site
-  Choose from the 4 levels of complexity
   - Normal: this should give you a mix of alphabets. Both Upper and Lower case.] and numbers
   - Adequate Strength: This uses Normal mode + special characters
   - Above Average: This uses a mix of numbers and characters
   - Nobody Can stop me yet: This mixes up, numbers, alphabets,and special characters.
- Next, choose the password length by dragging the bar, [longer passowrds to the right] and select submit.
