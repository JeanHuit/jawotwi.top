## Self Introduction

Passionate about people & technology. With a plethora of experience managing both people and technology. I am  currently a Technical Officer with the Communications Division of CSIR - Institute for Scientific and Technological Information. Here, I am responsible for transforming research outputs into software, tools, equipments and communication systems as tools for national development.

I am BIG about community and have spent the better part of the last decade; growing and managing various tech communities in Ghana. Most recent being the Google Developer Group (GDG). I ASPIRE to INSPIRE. 

I like to dabble in a lot of technology related things; from code to Rpi's.
